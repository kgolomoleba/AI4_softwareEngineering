## Assignment: Understanding the AI Development Workflow

---

### Course Details  
- **Course:** AI for Software Engineering  
- **Duration:** 7 days  
- **Total Points:** 100

## Objective & Guidelines

This assignment tests your ability to apply the **AI Development Workflow** to a real-world problem. You will demonstrate understanding of key stages—from problem definition to deployment—and critically analyze challenges and ethical considerations.

- Work in peer groups.  
- Submit a PDF report (5–10 pages excluding diagrams) with section headings and references.  
- Provide a GitHub repository with all code well-commented.  
- Share the PDF as an article in the PLP Academy Community.

## Part 1: Short Answer Questions (30 points)

### 1. Problem Definition (6 points)
- Define a hypothetical AI problem (e.g., "Predicting student dropout rates").  
- List **3 objectives** and **2 stakeholders**.  
- Propose **1 Key Performance Indicator (KPI)** to measure success.  

### 2. Data Collection & Preprocessing (8 points)
- Identify **2 data sources** for your problem.  
- Explain **1 potential bias** in the data.  
- Outline **3 preprocessing steps** (e.g., handling missing data, normalization).  

### 3. Model Development (8 points)
- Choose a model (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network) and justify your choice.  
- Describe how you would split data into training/validation/test sets.  
- Name **2 hyperparameters** you would tune and explain why.  

### 4. Evaluation & Deployment (8 points)
- Select **2 evaluation metrics** and explain their relevance.  
- Define **concept drift** and describe how you would monitor it post-deployment.  
- Describe **1 technical challenge** during deployment (e.g., scalability).

## Part 2: Case Study Application (40 points)

**Scenario:**  
A hospital wants an AI system to predict patient readmission risk within 30 days of discharge.

### Tasks:

#### Problem Scope (5 points)
- Define the problem, objectives, and stakeholders.

#### Data Strategy (10 points)
- Propose data sources (e.g., Electronic Health Records, demographics).  
- Identify **2 ethical concerns** (e.g., patient privacy).  
- Design a preprocessing pipeline, including feature engineering steps.

#### Model Development (10 points)
- Select a model and justify your choice.  
- Create a confusion matrix (hypothetical data).  
- Calculate precision and recall based on the confusion matrix.

#### Deployment (10 points)
- Outline steps to integrate the model into the hospital’s system.  
- Explain how to ensure compliance with healthcare regulations (e.g., HIPAA).

#### Optimization (5 points)
- Propose **1 method** to address overfitting.

## Part 3: Critical Thinking (20 points)

### Ethics & Bias (10 points)
- Discuss how biased training data might affect patient outcomes.  
- Suggest **1 strategy** to mitigate this bias.

### Trade-offs (10 points)
- Discuss the trade-off between **model interpretability** and **accuracy** in healthcare.  
- Explain how limited computational resources might impact model choice.

---

## Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram (10 points)

### Reflection (5 points)
- What was the most challenging part of the workflow? Why?  
- How would you improve your approach with more time/resources?

### Diagram (5 points)
- Sketch a flowchart of the AI Development Workflow, labeling all key stages.

## Tips  
- Review lecture notes on preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and CRISP-DM framework.  
- Remember to emphasize ethics and real-world constraints in your analysis.
